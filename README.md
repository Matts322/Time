# Time
Created this for practicing WPF and HttpRequests. It's a simple app, which shows you time and weather using OpenWeatherMap. Default location is Minsk, but you can change it. Also it has a simple dummy stopwatch(only seconds can be shown) and countdown. Maybe I will add possibility to switch time alongside with weather later. Thanks for watching ;)
